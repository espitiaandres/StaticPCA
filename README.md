## StaticPCA

- Python script that performs Static PCA (Principle Component Analysis) on a given csv containing process data. 
- PCA is applied for data modeling and process monitoring. 
- Static PCA specifically does not focus on time dependence on the data collected.


### Workflow

- Currently the script takes the TEPdataProc1dataCSV.csv file as input and performs static PCA.
- The script then outputs the principal component vectors into the PrincipleComponents.csv file.
